Lunchify - Rx.js Autocomplete
======
**Lunchify** is a small application to allow teams to choose a lunch location without the arguments.

I created lunchify as a mock application to practice functional programming using Rx.js and ES6.

The main Rx.js functionality is the search tool which iterates over arrays to autocomplete suggestions to the user. [Click here for search file.]("https://github.com/leesh22/Lunchify-Rx/blob/master/js/autoComplete/search.js")

I may improve on this project in the future, I may even launch it but for now it is just something I am messing around with. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
